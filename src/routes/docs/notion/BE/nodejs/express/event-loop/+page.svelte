				The Timer phase is responsible for managing and executing timer callbacks such as <code><strong>setTimeout</strong></code> and
				<code><strong>setInterval</strong></code>.
			</h2>
			<p class="" />
			<p class="">The workflow for the Timer phase can be described as follows:</p>
			<ol type="1" class="numbered-list" start="1">
				<li>
					<mark class="highlight-gray"
						>Entering Timer phase: The event loop enters the Timer phase to check for any timer callbacks ready to be executed.</mark>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<ol type="1" class="numbered-list" start="2">
				<li>
					<mark class="highlight-gray"
						>Timer queue: Timers are stored in a priority queue (heap memory) sorted in ascending order based on their expiration time.</mark>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<ol type="1" class="numbered-list" start="3">
				<li>
					<mark class="highlight-gray"
						>Check timers: The event loop iterates through the timer queue and calculates the difference between the current time and the
						timer&#x27;s registered time. If the difference is greater than or equal to the timer&#x27;s delay (now - registeredTime &gt;=
						delta), the timer is considered expired, and its callback is executed.</mark>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<ol type="1" class="numbered-list" start="4">
				<li>
					<mark class="highlight-gray">Execute timer callback: The event loop executes the callback function of the expired timer.</mark>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<ol type="1" class="numbered-list" start="5">
				<li>
					<mark class="highlight-gray"
						>Continue checking timers: The event loop continues checking the next timers in the queue. Since the timers are sorted in
						ascending order, it stops checking further timers as soon as it encounters a timer that hasn&#x27;t expired yet.</mark>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<ol type="1" class="numbered-list" start="6">
				<li>
					<mark class="highlight-gray"
						>Move to the next phase: After processing all expired timers, the event loop moves to the next phase.</mark>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="">
				The Timer phase efficiently handles timer callbacks and ensures that they&#x27;re executed at the appropriate time based on their
				specified delay. The sorted timer queue allows the event loop to quickly identify and execute expired timers and move to the next
				phase when there are no more timers to process.

			<h2 class=""><mark class="highlight-orange_background">Question</mark></h2>
			<p class="">
				<mark class="highlight-orange"
					>please check my understand is right, as far as I know the timer callbacks were stored in heap memory(on system memory) which
					format was queue - FIFO structure).</mark>
			</p>
			<h2 class=""><mark class="highlight-teal_background">Answer</mark></h2>
			<p class="">
				<mark class="highlight-teal"
					>Your understanding is partially correct. Timer callbacks are indeed stored in a heap data structure, but the heap is a priority
					queue that is sorted based on the timers&#x27; expiration times, not a simple FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue.</mark>
			</p>
			<p class="">
				<mark class="highlight-teal"
					>The heap data structure is used because it provides an efficient way to access and manage timers sorted by their expiration
					times. This allows the event loop to quickly find and execute expired timers during the Timer phase.</mark>
			</p>
			<p class="">
				<mark class="highlight-teal"
					>So, to recap: Timer callbacks are stored in a heap data structure (in system memory), which is a priority queue sorted by the
					timers&#x27; expiration times. This helps the event loop to efficiently manage and execute timer callbacks during the Timer phase.</mark>
			</p>
			<h2 class=""><mark class="highlight-orange_background">Question</mark></h2>
			<p class="">
				<mark class="highlight-orange">then what is the type of the queue which stored algorithm?</mark>
			</p>
			<h2 class=""><mark class="highlight-teal_background">Answer</mark></h2>
			<p class="">
				<mark class="highlight-teal"
					>The queue used to store timers in the Timer phase is a priority queue. This data structure is implemented as a binary heap, which
					is a specific type of binary tree that maintains the heap property. In the context of the Timer phase, the heap is a min-heap,
					where the node with the smallest expiration time is always at the root.</mark>
			</p>
			<p class="">
				<mark class="highlight-teal"
					>A priority queue efficiently maintains elements in a sorted order based on their priority. In the case of timers, the priority is
					determined by their expiration times. The min-heap property ensures that the timer with the earliest expiration time is always at
					the top of the heap, allowing the event loop to quickly access and process expired timers during the Timer phase.</mark>
			</p>
			<p class="">
				<mark class="highlight-teal"
					>The choice of a binary heap for implementing the timer queue provides an efficient solution for insertion, deletion, and
					retrieval of timers. This choice ensures that the timer management during the Timer phase is both time and space-efficient,
					enabling the event loop to handle a large number of timers without significant performance degradation.</mark>
